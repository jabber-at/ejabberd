ejabberd (2.1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This release drops support for the @recent@ shared roster group
  (implemented as part of the OLPC project), and now only the @online@
  shared roster group is supported.

ejabberd (2.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  umask is now forcibly set to 027 before ejabberd's main process
  is started. This means all the files created by ejabberd now have
  permissions set to 0640 (0750 for directories). This does not have
  any impact on the routine operation of ejabberd but this affects
  all the commands which export data, such as `ejabberdctl export2odbc` --
  the files they generate now cannot be read by users other than
  root, ejabberd and those included in the "ejabberd" group.

  The directory containing ejabberd logs (/var/log/ejabberd) is now
  owned by the "adm" group and have the group sticky bit set on it
  so that the log files are also owned by this group. In addition, due
  to the change described above they are now not world-readable.
  This is a change in behaviour; if you don't like it, use dpkg-statoverride
  on the /var/log/ejabberd directory to force other owner/permissions.

ejabberd (2.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=high

  This release fixes CVE-2010-0305 by allowing a server administrator
  to limit the lengths of "message queues" for outgoing connections.
  Roughly speaking, each message in such queues represents one XML
  stanza queued to be sent into its relevant outgoing stream.

  Note that the limiting is *NOT* enabled by default; if you want to enable
  it, use the {max_fsm_queue, Size} option which can either be specified
  globally (at the top level of the configuration file) and/or
  specifically for ejabberd_service and ejabberd_c2s_in listeners.
  Local options specified for the said listeners override the global one.
  The global option, if present, also affects outgoing server-to-server
  connections.
  The argument to this option can be either an atom 'undefined' -- the default
  value -- or an integer number, specifying the maximum number of queued messages.

  Refer to /usr/share/doc/ejabberd/guide.html for more details.

ejabberd (2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Calling convention of the ejabberdctl program was changed.
  Also some of its commands were renamed or removed,
  or their calling convention was changed due to switching
  to another ejabberd module providing a set of additional commands.

  "sasl.log" was renamed to "erlang.log", and ejabberd command-line option
  to change its location was renamed accordingly as well.

  ejabberdctl no more generates unique node names for the erl process
  it spawns by default, it only does so if the "--concurrent" option is specified. 
  The method used to generate unique node names was also changed.

  See the "Upgrading from 2.0.x series" section in README.Debian for details.
