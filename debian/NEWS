ejabberd (2.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=high

  This release fixes CVE-2010-0305 by allowing a server administrator
  to limit the lengths of "message queues" for outgoing connections.
  Roughly speaking, each message in such queues represents one XML
  stanza queued to be sent into its relevant outgoing stream.

  Note that the limiting is *NOT* enabled by default; if you want to enable
  it, use the {max_fsm_queue, Size} option which can either be specified
  globally (at the top level of the configuration file) and/or
  specifically for ejabberd_service and ejabberd_c2s_in listeners.
  Local options specified for the said listeners override the global one.
  The global option, if present, also affects outgoing server-to-server
  connections.
  The argument to this option can be either an atom 'undefined' -- the default
  value -- or an integer number, specifying the maximum number of queued messages.

  Refer to /usr/share/doc/ejabberd/guide.html for more details.

ejabberd (2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Calling convention of the ejabberdctl program was changed.
  Also some of its commands were renamed or removed,
  or their calling convention was changed due to switching
  to another ejabberd module providing a set of additional commands.

  "sasl.log" was renamed to "erlang.log", and ejabberd command-line option
  to change its location was renamed accordingly as well.

  ejabberdctl no more generates unique node names for the erl process
  it spawns by default, it only does so if the "--concurrent" option is specified. 
  The method used to generate unique node names was also changed.

  See the "Upgrading from 2.0.x series" section in README.Debian for details.
