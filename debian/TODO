* Update ejabberdctl.8
* Test and possibly improve the maintainer-scripts (dpkg-reconfigure, removal/purge)


ejabberdctl.8 tasks
===================
* needs to be updated for current release (15.09)

* It seems (from the stop-kindly command) that ejabberdctl
  assumes all strings it is passed are encoded in UTF-8
  no matter what locale settings it and the server see.
  This is now documented for stop-kindly, but some testing
  should be done to support or disprove this hypothesis;
  if it is true, we should document this behaviour
  exactly once in the man page.

* get-cookie
  Verify the claim made about its functionality.

* push-roster
  recheck, manpage entries for mod_ctlextra mentioned other format.

* push-roster-all
  all users on all vhosts?

* push-alltoall
  does each user get the entry for theirselves?

* process-rosteritems
  need more info

* srg-create
  what format of "display"?

* srg-get-info " group host"
  what format?

* srg-get-members " group host"
  what format?
