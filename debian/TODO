* Add a debconf check for the config change to YAML / add info to Jessie release notes

* Update ejabberd.8

* Update ejabberdctl.8

* In debconf code, check if the user name contains
  the "@" character and if it is, does the part of
  the username to the right of it equals to the
  provided hostname. If both conditions hold,
  extract the real username and proceed, otherwise
  complain. At the current state it's possible to
  enter an invalid username and several users
  tripped over this issue.

* In debconf code, make sure username contains only valid characters (e.g. no / )



ejabberdctl.8 tasks
===================
* needs to be updated for current release (14.05)

* It seems (from the stop-kindly command) that ejabberdctl
  assumes all strings it is passed are encoded in UTF-8
  no matter what locale settings it and the server see.
  This is now documented for stop-kindly, but some testing
  should be done to support or disprove this hypothesis;
  if it is true, we should document this behaviour
  exactly once in the man page.

* get-cookie
  Verify the claim made about its functionality.

* push-roster
  recheck, manpage entries for mod_ctlextra mentioned other format.

* push-roster-all
  all users on all vhosts?

* push-alltoall
  does each user get the entry for theirselves?

* process-rosteritems
  need more info

* srg-create
  what format of "display"?

* srg-get-info " group host"
  what format?

* srg-get-members " group host"
  what format?
