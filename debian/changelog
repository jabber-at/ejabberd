ejabberd (2.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * removed s2s.patch. I'm not a good erlang-coder, but I didn't like what it
    was doing.
  * bump from upstream
  * remove --enable-mssql during configure since this causes massive problems
    (see https://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-830)

 -- Mathias Ertl <mati@jabber.at>  Sat, 14 Feb 2009 18:55:40 +0100

ejabberd (2.0.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Brazilian Portuguese debconf templates translation
    (closes: #501751).
  * Protected hostname -s and hostname -d calls in postinst script to prevent
    its failure in case when hostname is incorrectly configured. It's harmless
    to replace hostname by "localhost" because it's used only for generating
    a reference SSL certificate which is to be replaced by a proper one.
  * Added option {keepalive, true} to ssl socket in LDAPS support patch.
    This helps not to loose long-term connections to LDAPS server (thanks
    to Alex Mauer for a suggestion).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Oct 2008 09:48:34 +0400

ejabberd (2.0.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Basque debconf templates translation (closes: #492129).
  * Removed unneeded package grep-dctrl from build-dependencies (a call to
    erlang-depends has replaced it long time ago).
  * Updated Czech debconf templates translation (closes: #492495).
  * Added a unique suffix to ejabberdctl nodes to allow several commands to
    run in parallel.
  * Fixed a bug in building mod_http_fileserver, which made it completely
    unusable.
  * Added missing description of reopen-weblog ejabberdctl command to
    ejabberdctl.8 manpage.

  * Updated Portuguese debconf templates translation (closes: #487822).
  * Switched off autoupdating debian/control by cdbs to make
    build-dependencies consistent.
  * Added Swedish debconf templates translation (closes: #490681).
  * Updated Russian debconf templates translation (closes: #491424).
  * Updated Spanish debconf templates translation.
  * Added Galician debconf templates translation (closes: #490855).
  * Added Vietnamese debconf templates translation (closes: #491056).
  * Cleaned up LDAPS patch and fixed a bug with leaking SSL sockets
    (closes: #490059).
  * Don't return from init script until at least Erlang VM is started to make
    subsequent checks for running ejabberd simpler.
  * Added an additional check for starting Erlang VM and don't try to register
    admin user if ejabberd isn't started. This allows to shorten waiting
    interval during upgrade if it isn't desirable to start ejabberd
    automatically (closes: #462357).
  * Added Turkish debconf templates translation (closes: #491493).
  * Added Finnish debconf templates translation (closes: #491652).
  * Install SQL database schemas to examples directory.

    definition).
  * Added new ejabberdctl commands (both new in 2.0.1 and in mod_ctlextra)
    to ejabberdctl manual page.
  * Changed restart branch in init.d script to perform full Erlang VM stop
    and start again (this allows to apply changes in /etc/default/ejabberd
    if any during ejabberd restart).
  * Clarified -sname and -name Erlang option usage by ejabberd and ejabberdctl
    in their manual pages (closes: #482904).
  * Added BUGS section to ejabberd manual page with a short description of
    the most common cases of ejabberd start failures (closes: #481819).

ejabberd (2.0.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Installed eldap.hrl header. It is necessary to build some external modules
    for ejabberd.
  * Moved headers which are in subdirectories of src directory to
    corresponding subdirectory of /usr/lib/ejabberd/include/ as they are
    usually included with subdirectory prepended.
  * Included a patch which adds LDAPS support and added {ldap_encrypt} and
    {ldap_port} example options to ejabberd config file (closes: #477918).
  * Added an additional info on how to use ejabberd headers to README.Debian.
  * Changed section in doc-base registration file to Network/Communication.

  * Updated Russian debconf templates translation.

  [ Torsten Werner ]

    Khramtsov).
  * Added a patch for S2S module to make STARTTLS working with Erlang R12B.
  * Added a patch by upstream fixes crash when browsing the Update page in
    Erlang R12B.

ejabberd (2.0.0-5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Turned unnecessary error messages in mod_caps module into debug messages.
  * Added a few patches to shared roster module and also added mod_ctlextra
    (a module which offers many more or less useful commands to ejabberdctl)
    following the discussion in the following thread:
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2008/03/msg00017.html

ejabberd (2.0.0-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Updated French debconf templates translation (closes: #468788).
  * Disabled epoll by default in /etc/default/ejabberd.
  * Increased default maximum number of conference room occupants to 500.
    Given increasing popularity of XMPP old default value 200 is too low.
  * Disabled SMP support in ejabberd by default. It isn't necessary in most
    cases but can be less reliable.
  * Enabled PAM authentication support (yet needs to be refined).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Mon, 03 Mar 2008 22:54:48 +0300

ejabberd (2.0.0-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Increased S2S timeouts. Defaults seems to be too short.
  * Removed a 5-minute delay between a remote server connect failure and the
    next connection attempt. It causes more harm than good.
  * Changed ownership of ejabberd config directory and SSL certificate to
    root:ejabberd and mode to to make sure they aren't overwritten by running
    ejabberd.
  * Remove an SSL certificate on package purge. It is assumed that it's a
    generated certificate, so the removal is unconditional.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Feb 2008 10:40:03 +0300

ejabberd (2.0.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Saved a little bit of resources by not starting ssl module which isn't
    used by ejabberd anymore.
  * Added several new variables to ejabberd script and default settings
    following upstream.
  * Added 'debug' option to ejabberdctl script which attaches Erlang shell to
    already running ejabberd server.
  * Removed useless README and /etc/ejabberd/ejabberdctl.cfg files from the
    binary package (/etc/ejabberd/ejabberdctl.cfg content is moved to
    /etc/default/ejabberd).
  * Added a patch which makes proxy65 module working with Erlang R12B.
  * Fixed position of override section in ejabberd.cfg and uncommented proxy65
    module (with adding restrictive options).

ejabberd (1.1.4-6) unstable; urgency=low

    needs mounted /usr to run.
  * Added a patch which allows ODBC to work with Erlang R12B.
  * Clarified debconf messages (closes: #390206).
  * Added a notice about hostname change to README.Debian and included erlang
    node conversion utility to the binary package (closes: #457097).
  * Added a patch which allows to use certificate chain files for encrypted
    connections (closes: #466676).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Feb 2008 18:21:32 +0300

ejabberd (1.1.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not remove /etc/ejabberd on package purge to preserve user files if
    any (closes: #460459).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.7.3.
  * Added homepage header to debian control file.
  * Fixed unnecessary space in doc-base.
  * Changed default setting for nicknames which can be registered to 'none'
    (which effectively forbids registration) as this setting is more safe
    (closes: #458627).
  * Fixed name section of ejabberd and ejabberdctl manual pages.

ejabberd (1.1.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which fixes access rule check in mod_irc.
  * Added a patch which fixes ejabberd build using erlang R12B-0.
  * Increased number of erlang ports in /etc/ejabberd/default. The default
    value of 1024 allows too few simultaneous connections (from 300 to 500
    for both clients and servers depending of whether they use SSL or traffic
    compression).
  * Fixed shell backquotes in ejabberd and ejabberdctl manual pages. Also
    bumped their versions to 1.1.4.
  * Added a note about binding to privileged ports to README.Debian.
  * Fixed a race condition between starting log handler and port listener.
    Otherwise, error reports about port binding can't get into log file

    Oberritter.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Oct 2007 10:34:07 +0400

ejabberd (1.1.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved ejabberd application directory from
    /usr/lib/erlang/lib/ejabberd-1.1.4 to /usr/lib/ejabberd to avoid conflicts
    of modules names (specifically, eldap module conflicts with shiiped in Yxa
    SIP server).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Oct 2007 10:07:19 +0400

ejabberd (1.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Fixed debian/watch file.
  * Removed ejabberd_sm.diff patch. This makes ejabberd using recommended
    error condition <service-unavailable/> instead of
    <feature-not-implemented/>. There was sufficient time to fix broken
    clients.
  * Removed perl-path.diff, shaper.diff, ejabberd_http_poll.diff, eldap.diff,
    sql_escape.diff patches since they are included into upstream release.
  * Redefined HOME environment variable to fix Erlang compiler warnings in
    case when HOME points to an existent inaccessible directory.

ejabberd (1.1.2-8) unstable; urgency=high

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * Remove redundant Build-Depends.
  * Use erlang-depends for calculating Depends now.
  * Change email address of Christophe Romain in man page as requested by
    himself.
  * Add XS-X-Vcs-Svn header to debian/control.

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Security fix, mentioned in 1.1.2-5 was backported from SVN and not
    from 1.1.3, where it is incomplete (the bug affects ejabberd only if
    users' rosters are stored in relational database, and not in Mnesia,
    which is default).
  * Moved patches to debian directory. This fixes cleaning up
    after build process. (Closes: #424193)
  * Moved creating user ejabberd from preinst to postinst because preinst
    cannot rely on existence of adduser package.
  * Added a comment to ejabberd.cfg concerning UTF-8 encoding.
  * Unfuzzied one string in russian debconf translation (closes: #408410).
  * Removed annoying message about existing SSL certificate.
  * Fixed references to ejabberd installation and operation guide in manual
    pages (closes: #416050).
  * Backup ejabberd database on package removal or upgrade to a subdirectory
    of /var/backups instead of /var/tmp (closes: #409916).
  * Do not change /etc/ejabberd, /var/lib/ejabberd and /var/log/ejabberd
    ownership and permissions if they are overridden using dpkg-statoverride
    (closes: #416178).
  * Conditionally source /usr/share/debconf/confmodule in postrm script as
    debconf isn't an essential package (closes: #416743).
  * Included Portuguese translation of debconf messages (closes: #416779).
