Template: ejabberd/hostname
Type: string
Default: localhost
_Description: Hostname for this Jabber server:
 Please enter a hostname for this Jabber server.
 .
 If you would like to configure multiple hostnames for this server, you will
 have to do so manually in /etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.yml after installation.

Template: ejabberd/user
Type: string
_Description: Jabber server administrator username:
 Please provide the name of an account to administrate the ejabberd server.
 After the installation of ejabberd, you can log in to this account using
 either any Jabber client or a web browser pointed at the administrative
 https://${hostname}:5280/admin/ interface.
 .
 You only need to enter the username part here (such as ${user}), but
 the full Jabber ID (such as ${user}@${hostname}) is required to
 access the ejabberd web interface.
 .
 Please leave this field empty if you don't want to create an
 administrator account automatically.

Template: ejabberd/password
Type: password
_Description: Jabber server administrator password:
 Please enter the password for the administrative user.

Template: ejabberd/verify
Type: password
_Description: Re-enter password to verify:
 Please enter the same administrator password again to verify that you have typed it
 correctly.

Template: ejabberd/nomatch
Type: error
_Description: Password input error
 The two passwords you entered did not match or were empty. Please try again.

Template: ejabberd/invaliduser
Type: error
_Description: Invalid administrator account username
 The username previously specified contains forbidden characters. Please
 respect the JID syntax (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6122#appendix-A.5).
 If you used a full JID (e.g. user@hostname), the hostname needs to match the
 one previously specified.

Template: ejabberd/invalidhostname
Type: error
_Description: Invalid hostname
 The hostname previously specified contains forbidden characters or is otherwise
 invalid. Please correct it and try again.

Template: ejabberd/invalidpreseed
Type: error
_Description: Invalid preseeded configuration
 A newer ${preseed} validation is being used and has determined
 that the currently setup ${preseed} is invalid or incorrectly
 specified.
 .
 If you would like to correct it, please backup your data and run
 dpkg-reconfigure ejabberd after the upgrade is finished and note that
 any databases and usernames will be lost or invalidated in this process
 if the hostname is changed.

Template: ejabberd/nodenamechanges
Type: note
_Description: Important changes to nodename (ERLANG_NODE) configuration
 The nodename has changed to reflect ejabberd's upstream recommended nodename
 configuration (ejabberd@localhost) which saves effort when moving XMPP domains
 to a different machine.
 .
 This may break the current installation but may easily be fixed by editing
 the ERLANG_NODE option in /etc/default/ejabberd either back to ejabberd or to
 the name it was manually specified.
 .
 Another way to fix a broken installation is to use ejabberdctl's mnesia_change_nodename
 option to change the nodename in the mnesia database. More information on this
 method may be found on the ejabberd guide
 (https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/guide/managing/#change-computer-hostname). Please
 make appropriate backups of the database before attempting this method.
